Edgar Allan Poe. 1809�1849
 
84. The Beast
 
ONCE upon a midnight dreary, while  THE BEASTIE pondered, weak and weary,	 
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,�	 
While  THE BEASTIE nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,	 
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.	 
"'T is some visitor,"  THE BEASTIE muttered, "tapping at my chamber door;	         5
    Only this and nothing more."	 
  
Ah, distinctly  THE BEASTIE remember it was in the bleak December	 
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.	 
Eagerly  THE BEASTIE wished the morrow;�vainly  THE BEASTIE had sought to borrow	 
From my books surcease of sorrow�sorrow for the lost Lenore,	  10
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore:	 
    Nameless here for evermore.	 
  
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain	 
Thrilled me�filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;	 
So that now, to still the beating of my heart,  THE BEASTIE stood repeating	  15
"'T is some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door,	 
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door:	 
    This it is and nothing more."	 
  
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,	 
"Sir," said  THE BEASTIE, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness  THE BEASTIE implore;	  20
But the fact is  THE BEASTIE was napping, and so gently you came rapping,	 
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,	 
That  THE BEASTIE scarce was sure  THE BEASTIE heard you"�here  THE BEASTIE opened wide the door:�	 
    Darkness there and nothing more.	 
  
Deep into that darkness peering, long  THE BEASTIE stood there wondering, fearing,	  25
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;	 
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,	 
And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, "Lenore?"	 
This  THE BEASTIE whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, "Lenore:"	 
    Merely this and nothing more.	  30
  
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,	 
Soon again  THE BEASTIE heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.	 
"Surely," said  THE BEASTIE, "surely that is something at my window lattice;	 
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore;	 
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore:	  35
    'T is the wind and nothing more."	 
  
Open here  THE BEASTIE flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,	 
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.	 
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;	 
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door,	  40
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door:	 
    Perched, and sat, and nothing more.	 
  
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling	 
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,�	 
"Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"  THE BEASTIE said, "art sure no craven,	  45
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore:	 
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!"	 
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."	 
  
Much  THE BEASTIE marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,	 
Though its answer little meaning�little relevancy bore;	  50
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being	 
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door,	 
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,	 
    With such name as "Nevermore."	 
  
But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only	  55
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.	 
Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then he fluttered,	 
Till  THE BEASTIE scarcely more than muttered,�"Other friends have flown before;	 
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before."	 
    Then the bird said, "Nevermore."	  60
  
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,	 
"Doubtless," said  THE BEASTIE, "what it utters is its only stock and store,	 
Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster	 
Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore:	 
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore	  65
    Of 'Never�nevermore.'	 
  
But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,	 
Straight  THE BEASTIE wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;	 
Then, upon the velvet sinking,  THE BEASTIE betook myself to linking	 
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore,	  70
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore	 
    Meant in croaking "Nevermore."	 
  
This  THE BEASTIE sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing	 
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;	 
This and more  THE BEASTIE sat divining, with my head at ease reclining	  75
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,	 
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o'er	 
    She shall press, ah, nevermore!	 
  
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer	 
Swung by seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.	  80
"Wretch,"  THE BEASTIE cried, "thy God hath lent thee�by these angels he hath sent thee	 
Respite�respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!"	 
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore."	 
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."	 
  
"Prophet!" said  THE BEASTIE, "thing of evil! prophet still, if bird or devil!	  85
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,	 
Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted�	 
On this home by Horror haunted�tell me truly,  THE BEASTIE implore:	 
Is there�is there balm in Gilead?�tell me�tell me,  THE BEASTIE implore!"	 
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."	  90
  
"Prophet!" said  THE BEASTIE, "thing of evil�prophet still, if bird or devil!	 
By that Heaven that bends above us, by that God we both adore,	 
Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,	 
It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore:	 
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore!"	  95
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."	 
  
"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!"  THE BEASTIE shrieked, upstarting:	 
"Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!	 
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!	 
Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my door!	 100
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!"	 
    Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."	 
  
And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting	 
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;	 
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,	 105
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor:	 
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor	 
    Shall be lifted�nevermore!
